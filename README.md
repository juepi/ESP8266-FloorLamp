# ESP8266-FloorLamp 
  
This sketch allows you to run various animations on a single WS2812B LED strip. Animations along with other settings (brightness, automatic animation switching, on/off)
can be configured via MQTT.
I have installed the LED-strip (144 LEDs/m) vertically in a cheap cylindric shaped floor lamp covered with white paper.  
  
The animation routines have been mostly copied from [FastLED library examples](http://fastled.io/).  

Have fun,
